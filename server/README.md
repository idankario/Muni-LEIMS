<h2> :book: Introduction</h2>

<p>Global electricity consumption is increasing by around 3% each year. Outdoor lighting is responsible for 15‚Äì19%
    of global electricity consumption, where lighting represents about 2.4% of the annual energetic resources of
    humanity, accounting for 5‚Äì6% of the total greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere and causing air pollution.
    In recent years, there have been significant changes in the global energy economy to reduce greenhouse gas
    emissions and air pollutants .
    Street lighting is an important part of municipalities‚Äô infrastructure, but its planning poses many challenges:
    lack of mapping of the street lighting network, the main malfunctions that feed the street lighting network, the
    presence of lighting poles in the middle of the road, illegal electrical connections, the lack of reference to
    the lighting system as a cause of road accidents and more .
    An annual report is conducted to help the Ministry of Energy to obtain data on the consumption of the
    municipalities and examine ways to improve efficiency. Still, many municipalities do not have a reasonable
    mapping of their streetlights and cannot give the details in their report, thus, pay high fines for filling out
    the report incorrectly. Existing such mapping systems for managing and identifying lighting poles are expensive
    and do not meet all the needs of the municipalities.
    Our system, Muni-LEIMS (=Municipal Light Energy Intensity Mapping System), is developed to support
    municipalities‚Äô efforts to manage their energy resources and promote energy efficiency with regard to
    streetlights. The system maps streetlight poles using artificial intelligence and computer vision, incorporating
    a calculation of an innovative measure of energy intensity that compares the average power consumption of a
    lighting pole to evaluate the energy efficiency of municipalities. The system is designed to be used by both
    municipalities and the Ministry of Energy.
    Muni-LEIMS was developed as part of a final project in Shenkar supervised by Prof. Avivit Levy, advised by Dr.
    Tal Goldrath, in collaboration of the Ministry of Energy, the municipalities: Ashdod, Tel Aviv, Kafr Qara, Tira,
    and using the support of AWS.
