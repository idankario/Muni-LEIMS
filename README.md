<h2> :book: Introduction</h2>

<p>In recent years, there have been significant changes in the global energy economy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants.
The Prime Minister, Naftali Bennett, and the Minister of Energy, Karin Elharar, agreed on 2050, Israel will reach zero [ref 9].
Our system, Muni-LEIMS, is developed to support municipalities‚Äô efforts to manage their energy resource and promote energy efficiency moves.
Global electricity consumption is increasing by around 3% each year. Outdoor lighting is responsible for 15‚Äì19% of global electricity consumption, lighting represents about 2.4% of the annual energetic resources of humanity, accounting for 5‚Äì6% of the total greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide have increased by 40% compared to the pre-industrial era, mainly due to the burning of fossil fuels. According to estimates, cities consume almost 75% of global energy, and outdoor urban lighting alone can account for as much as 20‚Äì40% of budget expenditure related to power [ref12].
Street lighting is an important part of municipalities infrastructure, which its planning has many considerations. One of them is security, since it reduces crime rates at night [ref 11].
